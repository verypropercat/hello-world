# hello-world
This repository is for learning the basics of the GitHub  Flow

It is a big task for me to describe who I am. 
I am NOT a fan of introductions.
Why?
Because over the course of my life
I have changed so much
and I am still discovering who I am
but for now
I guess I will tell you this:
I like anime, subbed is king
I play games to ignore depression
I do art sometimes
I want to learn to code so that maybe one day I can make my own game
